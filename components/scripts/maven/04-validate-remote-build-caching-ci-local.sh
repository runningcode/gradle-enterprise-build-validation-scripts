In this experiment, you will validate how well a given project leverages
Gradle Enterprise's remote build caching functionality when running the build
from a CI agent and then on a local machine. A build is considered fully
cacheable if it can be invoked twice in a row with build caching enabled and,
during the second invocation, all cacheable goals avoid performing any work
because:

  * The cacheable goals' inputs have not changed since their last invocation and
  * The cacheable goals' outputs are present in the remote build cache and
  * No cacheable goals were excluded from build caching to ensure correctness

The experiment will reveal goals with volatile inputs, for example goals that
contain a timestamp in one of their inputs. It will also reveal goals that
produce non-deterministic outputs consumed by cacheable goals downstream, for
example goals generating code with non-deterministic method ordering or goals
producing artifacts that include timestamps. It will also reveal goals that
contain an absolute file path in one of their inputs.

The experiment will assist you to first identify those goals whose outputs are
not taken from the remote build cache due to changed inputs or to ensure
correctness of the build, to then make an informed decision which of those goals
are worth improving to make your build faster, to then investigate why they are
not taken from the remote build cache, and to finally fix them once you
understand the root cause.

The first part of the experiment runs in your CI environment and the second
part of the experiment runs on any developer's machine. It logically consists of
the following steps:

  1. Enable only remote build caching and use an empty remote build cache
  2. On a given CI agent, run a typical CI configuration from a fresh checkout
  3. On a developer machine, run the build with the same goal invocation including the ‘clean’ goal with the same commit id
  4. Determine which cacheable goals are still executed in the second run and why
  5. Assess which of the executed, cacheable goals are worth improving
  6. Fix identified goals

The script you have invoked does not automate the execution of step 1 and step 2.
You will need to complete these steps manually. The script automates the
execution of step 3 without modifying the project. Build scans support your
investigation in step 4 and step 5.

After improving the build to make it better leverage the remote build cache,
you can push your changes and run the experiment again. This creates a cycle
of run → measure → improve → run.

${HEADER_COLOR}Run first build on CI agent${RESTORE}

You can now trigger the first build on one of your CI agents. The invoked CI
configuration should be a configuration that is typically triggered when
building the project as part of your pipeline during daily development.

Make sure the CI configuration uses the proper branch and performs a fresh
checkout to avoid any build artifacts lingering around from a previous build
that could influence the experiment.

Once the build completes, make a note of the commit id that was used, and enter
the URL of the build scan produced by the build.

${HEADER_COLOR}Fetch build scan data${RESTORE}

Now that the build on CI has finished successfully, some of the build scan
data will be fetched from the provided build scan to assist you in your
investigation.

The build scan data will be fetched via the Gradle Enterprise Export API. It is
not strictly necessary that you have permission to call the Export API while
doing this experiment, but the summary provided at the end of the experiment
will be more comprehensive if the build scan data is accessible. You can check
your granted permissions by navigating in the browser to the 'My Settings'
section from the user menu of your Gradle Enterprise UI. Your Gradle Enterprise
access key must be specified in the ~/.m2/.gradle-enterprise/keys.properties file.

https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#via_file

Some of the fetched build scan data is expected to be present as custom values.
By default, this experiment assumes that these custom values have been created
by the Common Custom User Data Maven extension. If you are not using that
extension but your build still captures the same data under different custom
value names, you can provide a mapping file so that the required data can be
extracted from your build scans. An example mapping file named 'mapping.example'
can be found at the same location as the script.

Now that the first build has finished successfully on CI and the build scan
data has been fetched or at least attempted to be fetched, the second build
can be run locally with the same commit id, the same Gradle goals, and the
same remote build cache as was used by the first build.

The local build will run after a fresh checkout of the given project stored in
Git. The fresh checkout ensures reproducibility of the experiment across machines
and users since no local changes and commits will be accidentally included in the
validation process.

Make sure the local build uses the proper branch and commit id.

The ‘Summary‘ section below captures the configuration of the experiment and the
two build scans that were published as part of running the experiment. The build
scan of the second build is particularly interesting since this is where you can
inspect what goals were not leveraging the remote build cache.

The ‘Performance Characteristics’ section below reveals the realized and
potential savings from build caching. All cacheable goals' outputs need to be
taken from the build cache in the second build for the build to be fully
cacheable.

The ‘Investigation Quick Links’ section below allows quick navigation to the
most relevant views in build scans to investigate what goals were avoided due to
remote build caching and what goals executed in the second build, which of those
goals had the biggest impact on build performance, and what caused those goals
to not be taken from the remote build cache.
