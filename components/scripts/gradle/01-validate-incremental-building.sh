In this experiment, you will validate how well a given project leverages
Gradle’s incremental build functionality. A build is considered fully
incremental if it can be invoked twice in a row with build caching disabled and,
during the second invocation, all tasks avoid performing any work because:

  * The tasks' inputs have not changed since their last invocation and
  * The tasks' outputs are still present

The experiment will reveal tasks with volatile inputs, for example tasks that
contain a timestamp in one of their inputs. It will also reveal tasks that produce
non-deterministic outputs consumed by tasks downstream that participate in
incremental building, for example tasks generating code with non-deterministic
method ordering or tasks producing artifacts that include timestamps.

The experiment will assist you to first identify those tasks that do not
participate in Gradle’s incremental build functionality, to then make an
informed decision which of those tasks are worth improving to make your build
faster, to then investigate why they do not participate in incremental building,
and to finally fix them once you understand the root cause.

The experiment can be run on any developer’s machine. It logically consists of
the following steps:

  1. Disable build caching completely
  2. Run the build with a typical task invocation including the 'clean' task
  3. Run the build with the same task invocation but without the 'clean' task
  4. Determine which tasks are still executed in the second run and why
  5. Assess which of the executed tasks are worth improving
  6. Fix identified tasks

The script you have invoked automates the execution of step 1, step 2, and step 3
without modifying the project. Build scans support your investigation in step 4
and step 5.

After improving the build to make it more incremental, you can push your changes
and run the experiment again. This creates a cycle of run → measure → improve → run.

Now that the project has been checked out, the first build can be run with the
given Gradle tasks. The build will be invoked with the 'clean' task included
and build caching disabled.

Now that the second build has finished successfully, you are ready to measure
in Gradle Enterprise how well your build leverages Gradle’s incremental build
functionality for the invoked set of Gradle tasks.

Some of the build scan data will be fetched from the build scans produced by
the two builds to assist you in your investigation.

The ‘Summary’ section below captures the configuration of the experiment and
the two build scans that were published as part of running the experiment. The
build scan of the second build is particularly interesting since this is where
you can inspect what tasks were not leveraging Gradle’s incremental build
functionality.

The ‘Investigation Quick Links’ section below allows quick navigation to the
most relevant views in build scans to investigate what tasks were up-to-date
and what tasks executed in the second build, which of those tasks had the
biggest impact on build performance, and what caused those tasks to not be
up-to-date.
